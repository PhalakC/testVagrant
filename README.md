Approach 
Selenium has been used to automate the test cases along with TestNG framework for assertions. Page Object Model has also been implemented using two different classes, one which has the location of the elements and the other one to run tests on them.

How to setup and run the code? 
Copy the code from GIT repository and paste in an IDE. Select Run AS >> TestNG test while running the code.

The no. of total test cases, passed test cases and failed test cases would be dispayed in the console.
